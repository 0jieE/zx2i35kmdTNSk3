  "message": "On this day, the world quietly turns a\npage, and I hope your page opens gently\ntoo.\n\nBefore anything else — thank you for\ntaking a moment to read my message and\nopen this link. It means more than you\nmight realize, and I appreciate the\ntime you gave to it.\n\nI wanted to wish you a birthday that\nfeels calm and kind, the kind where\nnothing needs to be perfect for the day\nto still feel good.\n\nYou have a calm and gentle presence.\nYou work hard, you're steady, and you\nmake a place feel lighter just by\nshowing up. Even in quiet moments, you\nbring a sense of ease that people\nnotice.\n\nI hope today gives you small moments of\npeace — a smile you didn't expect, a\npause when the world feels too busy, or\nsimply the feeling that the day is\ntreating you well.\n\nMay the year ahead be soft but full,\nwith work that feels manageable, days\nthat feel lighter, and people who\nappreciate who you are.\n\nAnd before I end this, I want to say\none more thing: I hope you're happy\nwith this small effort. It's simple,\nbut it's sincere — just a quiet way to\nwish you well on your day.\n\nHappy Birthday, Jonahlyn. I truly hope\nthe year ahead is kind to you."
